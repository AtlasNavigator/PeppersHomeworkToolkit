_# **WELCOME TO THE PEPPERS HOMEWORK TOOOLKIT!**_

The Peppers Homework Toolkit is my wonderful creation for aleviating the pain of having to do math the old-fashioned way. Now, with the help of The Peppers Homework Toolkit, you can calculate things like specific heat and fahrenheit to Celsius conversions in a jiffy!

This project has been made for the ground up to work offline for said occasions of needing to run this on a school laptop, as I know they can have some overly aggresive filters.

Now, I am a fan of the open source community, so I have chosen to put this project under the GPL v3 License so you can all feel free to fork, modify, and distribute this code, as long as you give back credit. Improvements are welcome.
